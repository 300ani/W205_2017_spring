For analyzing the health care quality across the states, the overall state hospitals have to be looked at, and not a few top hospitals as such. This implies that the hospitals haveto be ranked individually first based on their quality of healthcare, and then in each state they can be aggregated to arrive at an average score for the state which can then be used as the metric of comparison between the states.

The list of states based on this reasoning are listed below. These were the results from best_states.sql that runs two steps of query - one to get the best hospitals and the second to arrive at the average health care quality score for the states.
